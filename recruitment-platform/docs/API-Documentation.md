# Recruitment Platform API Documentation

This document outlines the API structure, authentication flow, error management, and scalability considerations for the recruitment platform.

## 1. API Structure and Design Decisions

The recruitment platform follows a RESTful API architecture.

### 1.1. Base URL
- Development: `http://localhost:3001/api`
- Production: (To be configured based on deployment environment)

### 1.2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and TypeScript.
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

### 1.3. Request and Response Format
- **Requests**: All requests should have a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json`.
- **Responses**: Responses are returned in JSON format.
  - Success responses typically include a `data` field.
  - Error responses include an `error` field with a message.

### 1.4. API Endpoints

#### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user.
  - Request Body: `{ email: string, password: string, name: string }`
  - Response: Success: `201 Created` with user data (excluding password). Error: `400 Bad Request` or `409 Conflict`.
- `POST /auth/login`: User login.
  - Request Body: `{ email: string, password: string }`
  - Response: Success: `200 OK` with JWT token and user data. Error: `401 Unauthorized`.
- `POST /auth/logout`: User logout (client-side token removal). (If server-side token invalidation is implemented, this endpoint would handle it).

#### Profile (Protected Routes)
- `GET /profile`: Get the current user's profile. Requires authentication.
  - Response: Success: `200 OK` with profile data. Error: `401 Unauthorized` or `404 Not Found`.
- `PUT /profile`: Update the current user's profile. Requires authentication.
  - Request Body: `{ name?: string, email?: string, ...otherProfileFields }`
  - Response: Success: `200 OK` with updated profile data. Error: `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, or `404 Not Found`.

### 1.5. Design Decisions
- **Statelessness**: API is designed to be stateless, with authentication managed via JWTs.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Controllers handle business logic, routes define endpoints, and models interact with the database.
- **TypeScript**: Used for backend and frontend to ensure type safety and improve code quality.
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration managed via `.env` files for flexibility across environments.

## 2. Authentication Flow and Security

### 2.1. Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**:
   - User submits registration details (`name`, `email`, `password`) to `POST /auth/register`.
   - Backend validates input (e.g., email format, password strength).
   - Password is hashed before storing in the database (e.g., using bcrypt).
   - User is created, and a success response is returned.

2. **Login**:
   - User submits `email` and `password` to `POST /auth/login`.
   - Backend finds the user by email.
   - Backend compares the provided password with the hashed password in the database.
   - If credentials are valid, a JWT is generated.
   - The JWT and user data (excluding sensitive info like password) are sent back to the client.
   - Client stores the JWT (e.g., in `localStorage` or a secure cookie).

3. **Accessing Protected Routes**:
   - For subsequent requests to protected endpoints (e.g., `GET /profile`), the client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
   - Backend middleware (`auth.ts`) checks for the token in the header.
   - If valid, the request is processed; otherwise, an error is returned (e.g., `401 Unauthorized`).

### 2.2. Security Measures
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storage.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens are used for stateless authentication.
  - Tokens have an expiration time (e.g., 1 hour).
  - Secret key is securely stored in environment variables.
- **CORS**: Configured to allow requests from the frontend origin.
- **Input Validation**: Both frontend and backend validate user inputs to prevent malformed data and injection attacks.
- **Helmet**: (Recommended) Use `helmet` middleware in Express to set various HTTP headers for enhanced security.
- **Rate Limiting**: (Recommended) Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks on login endpoints.
- **HTTPS**: (Essential for Production) Must be used to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data (database credentials, JWT secret) are stored in `.env` files and not committed to version control.
- **Session Timeout**: Client-side hooks (e.g., `useSessionTimeout`) can manage user session inactivity.

### 2.3. Protected Route Middleware
- The `auth.ts` middleware is used to protect routes.
- It extracts the JWT from the `Authorization` header.
- It verifies the token's signature and expiration.
- If valid, it may attach user information to the request object for downstream use.

## 3. Error Management and Invalid Input Handling

### 3.1. Error Handling Strategy
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Express middleware is used to catch errors and send consistent error responses.
- **Custom Error Types**: (Optional) Can be created for specific error conditions (e.g., `ValidationError`, `AuthenticationError`).
- **Logging**: Errors should be logged server-side for debugging (e.g., using Winston or Morgan).
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Generic error messages are returned to clients to avoid exposing sensitive system details.

### 3.2. Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Descriptive error message for the user.",
    "code": "ERROR_CODE_UNIQUE_TO_ERROR_TYPE"
  }
}
```
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Appropriately used to indicate the type of error.
  - `400 Bad Request`: For validation errors or malformed requests.
  - `401 Unauthorized`: For missing or invalid authentication.
  - `403 Forbidden`: If user is authenticated but lacks permissions (relevant for future roles).
  - `404 Not Found`: When a requested resource doesn't exist.
  - `409 Conflict`: For conflicts, e.g., registering an existing email.
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: For unexpected server-side errors.

### 3.3. Invalid Input Handling
- **Frontend Validation**:
  - Uses utility functions (e.g., `validation.ts`) for client-side validation before submission.
  - Provides immediate feedback to the user.
- **Backend Validation**:
  - Primary validation occurs on the server.
  - `express-validator` to validate request bodies and parameters.
  - Specific validation rules:
    - Email: Valid email format.
    - Password: Minimum length, complexity requirements (e.g., uppercase, number, special character).
    - Name: Minimum length, alphanumeric and basic characters.
- **Database Constraints**:
  - Unique constraints on fields like email to prevent duplicates.
  - Database-level validation as a secondary layer.

### 3.4. Example Error Scenarios
- **Registration with Existing Email**:
  - Frontend: May check email availability or server returns `409 Conflict`.
- **Weak Password**:
  - Frontend: Shows password strength requirements.
  - Backend: Rejects with `400 Bad Request` if password doesn't meet criteria.
- **Invalid Login Credentials**:
  - Backend: Returns `401 Unauthorized`.
  - Generic message like "Invalid email or password" to prevent user enumeration.
- **Expired Token**:
  - Backend: Returns `401 Unauthorized`.
  - Frontend: Redirects to login page.

## 4. Scalability Suggestions

### 4.1. Current Considerations
The prototype is well-structured for scalability, utilizing TypeScript, modular routing, and a separation of concerns.

### 4.2. Architectural Scalability
- **Load Balancing**:
  - Deploy multiple instances of the backend application behind a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, AWS ELB).
  - This distributes traffic and improves availability.
- **Horizontal Scaling**:
  - Design the application to be stateless where possible (authentication via JWT helps).
  - This allows easy addition of more server instances to handle increased load.
- **Microservices**:
  - For larger applications, consider breaking down into microservices (e.g., separate user service, job posting service, application service).
  - Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
  - Requires an API Gateway (e.g., Kong, AWS API Gateway) to manage requests.

### 4.3. Database Scalability
- **Indexing**: Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried fields (e.g., `email`, `userId`) to improve query performance.
- **Connection Pooling**: Use database connection pooling to efficiently manage and reuse database connections.
- **Database Sharding**: If data volume becomes very large, consider sharding the database to distribute the load across multiple servers.
- **Read Replicas**: For read-heavy applications, set up read replicas to distribute database read queries.
- **NoSQL for Unstructured Data**: If dealing with highly unstructured data or needing more flexible schemas, NoSQL databases (like MongoDB, which seems likely) can be a good fit.
- **Database Choice**: Evaluate if the current database choice (e.g., MongoDB) is optimal for long-term data structure and query patterns.

### 4.4. Caching Strategy
- **In-Memory Cache**:
  - Use an in-memory cache like Redis or Memcached for frequently accessed data that doesn't change often (e.g., user sessions, job listings, common lookups).
  - Reduces database load and improves response times.
- **CDN**:
  - For static assets (images, CSS, JS), use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve them from locations closer to the user.

### 4.5. API Optimization
- **Pagination**:
  - Implement pagination for list endpoints (e.g., `/jobs?page=1&limit=10`) to avoid returning large amounts of data in a single response.
- **Optimized Queries**:
  - Write efficient database queries and avoid N+1 query problems.
- **Response Compression**:
  - Enable Gzip or Brotli compression for API responses to reduce payload size.

### 4.6. Deployment and DevOps
- **Containerization**:
  - Use Docker to containerize the application and its dependencies.
  - This ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Orchestration**:
  - Use Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker Swarm for container orchestration to manage deployment, scaling, and networking of containerized applications.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI).
  - Automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - Use tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage and provision infrastructure.

### 4.7. Monitoring and Logging
- **Centralized Logging**:
  - Aggregate logs from all services to a central system (e.g., ELK Stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; or cloud services like AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Logging).
- **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**:
  - Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or Dynatrace to monitor application performance, identify bottlenecks, and track user experience.
- **Health Checks**:
  - Implement health check endpoints (e.g., `/health`) that load balancers can use to determine the health of instances.

### 4.8. Future Enhancements for Scale
- **Asynchronous Processing**:
  - For long-running tasks (e.g., sending emails, complex report generation), use a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) and worker processes.
  - This prevents HTTP requests from timing out and improves responsiveness.
- **Advanced Security**:
  - Implement API rate limiting more robustly.
  - Consider OAuth 2.0 for third-party integrations.
  - Regular security audits and dependency vulnerability scanning.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**:
  - Maintain distinct configurations for development, staging, and production environments.

By considering these scalability suggestions, the recruitment platform prototype can be effectively grown to accommodate increased users, data, and feature complexity.
